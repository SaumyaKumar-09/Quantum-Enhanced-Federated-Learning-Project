# **Quantum-Enhanced Federated Learning for Predictive Diagnostics**

## **Overview**
This project explores the integration of quantum machine learning (QML) with federated learning for predictive diagnostics in healthcare. By leveraging quantum-enhanced algorithms, federated architectures, and privacy-preserving mechanisms, this model addresses challenges related to high-dimensional healthcare data and sensitive patient information.

---

## **Features**
- **Federated Learning Framework**: Simulates decentralized training across multiple clients, enabling collaborative learning without sharing raw data.
- **Quantum SVM Integration**: Enhances predictive accuracy using quantum kernel-based SVMs powered by Qiskit.
- **Privacy and Security**: Implements differential privacy and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) for robust data protection.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Handles missing values and scales data for compatibility with machine learning models.

# **Running the Project**

## **Step 1: Data Preparation**
Clean and normalize healthcare data:
```python
from data_preprocessing import clean_data, normalize_data
X_cleaned = clean_data(X)
X_normalized = normalize_data(X_cleaned)
```

## **Step 2: Federated Learning Setup**
Simulate federated clients and train the model:
```python
from federated_learning import init_federated_clients, train_federated_model
clients = init_federated_clients(5)
model_info = train_federated_model(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 3: Quantum SVM
Run a quantum-enhanced SVM using Qiskit:

```python
from quantum_svm import run_quantum_algorithm
predictions = run_quantum_algorithm(X_train, y_train, X_test)
```

## Step 4: Privacy Integration
Apply differential privacy and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC):

```python
from privacy_mechanisms import apply_differential_privacy, secure_multiparty_computation
X_private = apply_differential_privacy(X_normalized)
secure_data = secure_multiparty_computation(X_private)
```

## Step 5: Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, predictions)
```
